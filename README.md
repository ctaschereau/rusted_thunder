# rusted_thunder
Rust app to interact with the Tesla API.
This could eventually be used as a replacement for the official Tesla Android or iOS app.

## Config
A config file is required for this app to function. At the moment, the file must be named *.teslac* and must reside in the user's home folder.
Also, it must be a valid .toml file and contain the following properties :
```
[global]
api_token = "____SOME_API_TOKEN_OBTAINED_FROM_A_LOGIN_ENDPOINT____"
default_vehicle = "CAR_NAME_GOES_HERE"
``` 
At the moment, the api_token needs to be generated from outside of this app.
